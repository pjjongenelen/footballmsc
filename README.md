# Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Football Player Match Performance Analysis 

Master thesis project by Tim Jongenelen

---

This project consists of 4 main steps - for now...
1. Preprocess the raw tweets into a format that is usable for the RobBERT model.
2. Manually annotate a bunch of preprocessed tweets and fine-tune the model.
3. Use the fine-tuned model to annotate all preprocessed tweets.
4. Compare the results of step 3 with the grades given bij AD, VI, and FotMob to test the validity of Twitter SA for football performance analysis. 

See the [pipelines overview](res/pipeline_overview.pdf) for a graphical representation of steps 1-3:
